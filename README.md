# Handcraft

A small front-end framework for constructing declarative and reactive UI.

Install it from jsr `deno add jsr:@handcraft/lib` or import from a cdn
`import * as Handcraft from "https://esm.sh/jsr/@handcraft/lib"`;

As of 1.14.0 the API is stable and following semver. Before that break changes
were introduced a few times.
