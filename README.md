# Handcraft

A tiny front-end framework for constructing declarative/reactive UI. Install from NPM, or get it from a CDN like [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/erickmerchant/handcraft@latest/prelude/all.js) and add it to your import map.

## Inspiration

Much of the API is inspired by Rust and its ecosystem. The rest is the latest iteration of ideas I've had since around 2015. I need to mention the following as inspiration though.

- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
- [Ender](https://github.com/ender-js/Ender)
- [HyperScript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript)
- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
