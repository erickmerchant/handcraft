# Handcraft

A small front-end framework for constructing declarative and reactive UI. Install from NPM, or get it from a CDN like [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/erickmerchant/handcraft@latest/prelude/all.js) and add it to your import map. The API is fairly stable and I'm using it on many small projects. I'm actively working on the docs and tests, and when those are done version 1.0.0 will be ready.
